# Reflection
The end result of the website is not exactly the same as the prototypes I made previously. Most of the style choices were on purpose, like changing the colours, as I never liked the shade of purple I used in for the boxes anyways. The change for the gallery is because I thought, since the catalogue code was provided to us, it would be easier to implement it this way. I didn't end up getting the build working in the end, I ended up with errors saying I didn't have {base} files in the app.html file, but it wouldn't work when I added them to the file either. I'm really disappointed with myself in that regard, I shouldn't have left it so late that I couldn't figure out the error.
