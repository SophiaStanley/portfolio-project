# Reflection
The end result of the website is not exactly the same as the prototypes I made previously. Most of the style choices were on purpose, like changing the colours, as I never liked the shade of purple I used in for the boxes anyways. The change for the gallery is because I thought, since the catalogue code was provided to us, it would be easier to implement it this way. The drawing of myself on the home page is unfinished, I was hoping to have a completed version, and I also wanted to add animations and transitions to my website, but I ended up running out of time. I hope to either improve this website or make a new one over the summer.
